Exploring Bikeshare Data

The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

    Most popular month
    Most popular day
    Most popular hour
    Most popular start station
    Most popular end station
    Most popular combination of start and end stations
    Total trip duration
    Average trip duration
    Types of users by number
    Types of users by gender (if available)
    The oldest user (if available)
    The youngest user (if available)
    The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

Acknowledgements

    xhlow - xhlow's repository helped with understanding the structure and details of certain functions.
    philribbens - philribben's repository also added to better understanding of the structure for this project.
    pandas docs - pandas documentation was immensely helpful in understanding the implemention of pandas methods used in this project.
    Udacity - Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and their instructors were extremely helpful while I was pursuing this project.
    Finally, I'd like to mention my college courses on Principles of Econometrics and Intermediary Econometrics for introducing me to data analysis and R programming. The concepts embodied in the pandas library (e.g. data frame) were very similar to the ones used while I was working on my R projects for college assignments.
